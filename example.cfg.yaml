# A list of network paths to use for routing traffic.
# Each path can be of type 'direct' or 'proxy'.
paths:
  - type: direct # Direct connection through the first internet connection.

  - type: direct # Direct connection through the second internet connection.
    addr: 192.168.57.206 # IP address of Network Adapter #2.

  - type: direct # Direct connection through the third internet connection.
    addr: 192.168.137.211 # IP address of Network Adapter #3.

  - type: proxy # Connection through the first proxy server.
    addr: socks5://127.0.0.1:1081 # SOCKS5 proxy address.

  - type: proxy # Connection through the second proxy server.
    addr: socks5://127.0.0.1:1082 # SOCKS5 proxy address.
